# Tic-Tac-Glow
A small, mobile responsive implementation of tic-tac-toe using vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. Users can specify their name and colour-counter choice or revert to default choices. A running tally is kept after each game. 

For particularly tense and invested matches a resume function is available which saves the board and score state using the user's local storage. 

## Environments
Tic-Tac-Glow was developed using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The save function take advantage of JS' local storage capabilities.

## Discussion
TTG is my most complete purely front-end project to date and my first attempt at mobile-responsiveness. I began the project with the mindset of keeping the design simple and my code readable and uncluttered. 

In particular I wanted to avoid adding redundant lines of CSS and jscript - I wanted the design and functionality of the game to be readable in the code. 

## things to add:

### high priority
~~remove h3 once game starts~~

~~play again button~~  

~~restart game logic~~

~~drop down colour menu~~

 ~~disable alt user selection~~


### low priority
make win / game over screen more eventful


## 'accidental features'
~~a draw results in the last player being awarded a point~~

cruel players can change their colors multiple times, locking
out other player from choosing a color.

if one player highlights 'blue' using keys instead of clicking and second player selects 'blue' then both players will end up being represented as blue

~~players can both choose white~~
